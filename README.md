# 99 Haskell Problems - Solutions

Welcome to my repository containing solutions to the [**99 Haskell Problems**](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems), a well-known collection of programming challenges designed to help learners master functional programming concepts using Haskell. These problems cover a wide range of topics including lists, arithmetic, logic, trees, and graphs, and serve as a great resource for anyone looking to improve their skills in Haskell.

## About the Problems

The 99 Haskell Problems are a series of exercises that challenge you to solve common algorithmic problems using the functional programming paradigm. Each problem is designed to deepen your understanding of Haskell's core concepts such as recursion, higher-order functions, lazy evaluation, and pattern matching.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is accompanied by a solution written in Haskell. The problems are grouped by topic, such as:

- **Lists** <br>
- **Arithmetic**
- **Logic and Codes**
- **Binary/Multiway Trees**
-    The following categories will be in future problems:
- **Graphs**

Each solution is implemented with clarity and efficiency in mind, following idiomatic Haskell practices.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference for learning. If you are working on the problems yourself, I recommend attempting to solve them independently before reviewing the solutions in this repository. However, if you want to test/change my solutions, you should be aware that the code was tested with the help of cabal compiler.

## Contribution

Contributions and improvements are welcome! If you find optimizations or alternative approaches, feel free to open a pull request or suggest changes.
